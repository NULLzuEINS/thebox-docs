# TheBox

Hello and welcome to the “Box”! When I travel, I also like to stay in AirBnB's and sometimes I wish I had a piece of paper with all the necessary information about accommodation, check-in and check-out and this is my attempt to make it better:

## Checkin

### Key

You get two pairs of keys, each with one key for the bottom and one for the top. There is also a key on a key chain that you can use to lock your room.

### Internet access

```txt
SSID:     hamburg-bei-nacht
Passwort: landungsbruecken
```

Or you scan this QR code, it will automatically connect you to the network:
