# Welcome

Hello and welcome to the ‚ÄúBox‚Äù! When I travel, I also like to stay in AirBnB's and sometimes I wish I had a piece of paper with all the necessary information about the accommodation, check-in and check-out and this is my attempt to make it better.

> [!A notice]I will have the document automatically translated into your language. I hope it's somewhat understandable. If not, feel free to write me a message. I then try to improve it.

## Pictures

On my AirBnB you get a detailed overview of all the rooms and the facilities. Here is just a brief overview:

# The rooms

![Raumplan](_media/thebox-map.png)

## Kitchen

Since I usually eat downstairs with my family, the kitchen is very spartan. Unfortunately, washing up can only be done in the sink in the bathroom. But there is a special container for washing up.

2.  Wo kann ich abwaschen? Das geht nur im Bad. Es gibt einen speziellen Beh√§lter zum abwaschen.

## Your room

The mattresses are placed on top of each other for storage purposes only. You can distribute them according to your needs.
If you replace the cushions on the couch with a mattress, it makes a good bed.

2.  Computers & Printers
3.  Remote controls for lights and electricity

### Remote controls

An old German saying applies to all remote controls: ‚ÄúTrying is better than studying‚Äù. You can't break anything. Press a few buttons and see what happens. If you still want to study, here is the right reading for you:

### FAQ - Your room

1.  The light doesn't come on or flashes wildly. Use the small remote controls with the colorful buttons.

### bathroom

You can use the shower while standing. It's not a problem if the ground gets a little wet. Only turn the water on 1/3 and hang the bath mat over the heater to dry.

The Alexa on the wall goes by the name ‚ÄúComputer‚Äù and also plays your favorite music or radio. E.g. "_Computer, play Deutschlandfunk Nova_"

You can hang towels on all hooks and put your things anywhere. There is a shelf in front of the bathroom door. One of them is yours.

### Hallway

You are welcome to leave your shoes here. I also have a small notepad on the shelf in case you want to tell me something.

# Miscellaneous

## Smart Home

There are Alexa voice assistants in the bathroom and kitchen. You can address them by the name ‚ÄúComputer‚Äù and have them play Deutschlandfunk Nova, for example. They understand German and also English. If you don't want to use them,
You can also simply disconnect it from the power.

There are no voice assistants in your room. The basket on the shelf only contains the router and a small computer.

## temperature and humidity

The temperature and humidity are automatically measured via the sensors. I use them to prevent mold formation. They are small and white and usually lie on door frames. You can read some of the measurement data in the mirror in the hallway.

?> Please make sure to ventilate regularly (at least once a day). Especially in the bathroom. Also make sure that the heating is turned off. Thank you üôè

## The yard

In our courtyard you can connect your bikes and take away your rubbish.

![Innenhof](_media/thebox-map-surroundings.png)

### How does the gate open?

Either you use the front door key, or you reach through the gate and feel the button to open the door. While you hold down the button you can open the door.

![Der Knopf √∂ffnet Dir](_media/surroundings-button.jpeg ":size=144")

### Yellow? Blue? Green? Brown?

Are you wondering why the garbage cans have different colors? If you are unsure, always put the trash in the green bin. The residual waste ends up in there. Professionals put paper waste in the blue bin, recyclables in the yellow bin and organic waste in the brown bin.

### Cycles

### Is my bike safe?

Leipzig is a very bike-friendly city. Through the large city park that divides the city into two halves, you can get to many places and usually drive through the countryside.
If you believe the statistics, then the most bicycles per capita are stolen in Leipzig every year. (1,539 stolen bicycles per 100,000 inhabitants) In the 15 years since I have lived here on Hardenbergstra√üe, I have never had a bicycle stolen and I only know of one neighbor whose bicycle was stolen from his backyard. I always connect it directly to the railing.

### What alternatives are there?

With the[Leipzig MOVE App](https://leipzig-move.de/), you get 10 free rides of 15 minutes each for the_Nextbikes_. Note that it costs more if you don't park your bikes on the main streets (purple on the map). The e-scooters may only be parked in certain parking spaces. There is also a free-float car-sharing system. That means with us[cityflitzer](https://cityflitzer.de/). And of course there are buses and trains that you could also pay for via the Leipzig MOVE app.

# Checkout

## Key

-   Depending on what day of the week it is, we can say goodbye in person, or you can simply put the keys on the desk and close the door behind you.
-   The latest time for checkout is 7 p.m. on the day of departure.

## cleaning

-   You can leave bedding on it.
-   I also wash the dishes and
-   I also take out the trash.

> Short version: Leave the key there, close the door, that's it. üòÄ

# Longer stay

?> Some of my guests stay for a month or longer. If you are one of them, then this section is for you!

## washing machine

You can use the washing machine without having to ask first. You can also use the drying rack, washing powder and fabric softener. If you would like new bed linen, just talk to me.

## Hand brush and dustpan

In the kitchen you will find a hand brush and a dustpan on the wall. This will help you get rid of the small dirt.

## Wipe

You can find green cleaning agent in a spray bottle in the bathroom for mopping. Together with the kitchen paper, this can be used to clean surfaces easily.

## Vacuum cleaner

I have a robot vacuum cleaner for the floor.
Before you can start, clear everything on the floor out of the way.
Especially cords or other things that the robot could choke on.
Then put it in your room and press the button on the top once.
If nothing happens, use the on/off switch on the side and after
turn it on again using the button on the top.

When it's finished, please put it back in the charging station!
