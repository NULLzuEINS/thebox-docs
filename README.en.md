# TheBox

Hello and welcome to the “Box”! When I travel, I also like to stay in AirBnB's and sometimes I wish I had a piece of paper with all the necessary information about accommodation, check-in and check-out and this is my attempt to make it better:

## Checkin

### Key

You get two pairs of keys, each with one key for the bottom and one for the top. There is also a key on a key chain that you can use to lock your room.

### Internet access

```txt
SSID:     hamburg-bei-nacht
Passwort: landungsbruecken
```

Or you scan this QR code, it will automatically connect you to the network:

### Küche

Since I usually eat downstairs with my family, the kitchen is very spartan. Unfortunately, washing up can only be done in the sink in the bathroom. But there is a special container for washing up.

## Tips

With the Leipzig MOVE app, you get 10 free rides of 15 minutes each_Nextbikes_. Note that it costs more if you don't park your bikes on the main streets (purple on the map). The e-scooters may only be parked in certain parking spaces.

## Questions?

If you have any questions or need support, I will be happy to help you. If you're in a hurry, it's best to do so via telephone `+49 170 73 53 067` . You can also use the pre-installed messenger app with limited functionality (SMS). Otherwise, I have a notepad and a pen in the hallway.

I wish you a nice stay in Leipzig!
Andre
