# Welcome

Hello and welcome to the “Box”! When I travel, I also like to stay in AirBnB's and sometimes I wish I had a piece of paper with all the necessary information about the accommodation, check-in and check-out and this is my attempt to make it better.

## Pictures

On my AirBnB you get a detailed overview of all the rooms and the facilities. Here is just a brief overview:

Since I usually eat downstairs with my family, the kitchen is very spartan. Unfortunately, washing up can only be done in the sink in the bathroom. But there is a special container for washing up.

### FAQ - Your room

1.  The light doesn't come on or flashes wildly. Use the small remote controls with the colorful buttons.

### bathroom

You can use the shower while standing. It's not a problem if the ground gets a little wet. Only turn the water on 1/3 and hang the bath mat over the heater to dry.

The Alexa on the wall goes by the name “Computer” and also plays your favorite music or radio. E.g. "_Computer, play Deutschlandfunk Nova_"

You can hang towels on all hooks and put your things anywhere.

### Hallway

You are welcome to leave your shoes here. I also have a small notepad on the shelf in case you want to tell me something.

# Miscellaneous

## Smart Home

There are Alexa voice assistants in the apartment. You can address them by the name “Computer” and have them play Deutschlandfunk Nova, for example. The devices are connected to the Internet and can also be used as alarm clocks or timers. If you don't want to use it, you can simply unplug it from the power supply.

There are no voice assistants in your room. The basket on the shelf only contains the router and a small computer.

## temperature and humidity

The temperature and humidity are automatically measured via the sensors. I use them to prevent mold formation. They are small and white and usually lie on door frames. You can read some of the measurement data in the mirror in the hallway.

> Please make sure to ventilate regularly (at least once a day). Especially in the bathroom. Also make sure that the heating is turned off. Thank you 🙏

# Checkout

## Key

-   Depending on what day of the week it is, we can say goodbye in person, or you can simply put the keys on the desk and close the door behind you.
-   The regular checkout time is 11 a.m.
-   If you would like to leave your luggage behind on the day of departure and only pick it up later in the day, we can arrange this individually.

## cleaning

-   You can leave bedding on it.
-   I also wash the dishes and
-   I also take out the trash.

> Short version: Leave the key there, close the door, that's it. 😀

# Tips

With the Leipzig MOVE app, you get 10 free rides of 15 minutes each_Nextbikes_. Note that it costs more if you don't park your bikes on the main streets (purple on the map). The e-scooters may only be parked in certain parking spaces.

# Questions?

If you have any questions or need support, I will be happy to help you. If you're in a hurry, it's best to do so via telephone <a href="tel:+491707353067">+49 170 73 53 067</a>. You can also use the pre-installed messenger app with limited functionality (SMS). Otherwise, I have a notepad and a pen in the hallway.

I wish you a nice stay in Leipzig!
Andre
