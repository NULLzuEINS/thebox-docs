# TheBox

Hello and welcome to the “Box”! When I travel, I also like to stay in AirBnB's and sometimes I wish I had a piece of paper with all the necessary information about the accommodation, check-in and check-out and this is my attempt to make it better.

## Checkin

### Key

You get two pairs of keys, each with one key for the bottom and one for the top. There is also a key on a keychain that you can use to lock your room.

### Internet access

```txt
SSID:     hamburg-bei-nacht
Passwort: landungsbruecken
```

Or you scan this QR code, it will automatically connect you to the network:

## The rooms

### Kitchen

Since I usually eat downstairs with my family, the kitchen is very spartan. Unfortunately, washing up can only be done in the sink in the bathroom. But there is a special container for washing up.

2.  Where can I wash up? This only works in the bathroom. There is a special container for washing dishes.

### Your room

The mattresses are placed on top of each other for storage purposes only. You can distribute them according to your needs. If you replace the pillows on the couch with a mattress, it makes a good bed.

You are welcome to use the computer and printer.

3.  Remote controls for lights and electricity

#### FAQ - Your room

1.  The light doesn't come on or flashes wildly. Use the small remote controls with the colorful buttons.

#### bathroom

Die Dusche kannst du ruhig im Stehen benutzen. Es ist nicht schlimm, wenn der Boden etwas nass wird. Dreh das Wasser nur 1/3  auf und häng den Badewannenvorleger  zum trocknen über der Heizung auf.

The Alexa on the wall goes by the name “Computer” and also plays your favorite music or radio. E.g. "_Computer, play Deutschlandfunk Nova_"

You can hang towels on all hooks and put your things anywhere.

#### Hallway

You are welcome to leave your shoes here. I also have a small notepad on the shelf in case you want to tell me something.

## Checkout

-   We will discuss the key handover individually.
-   You can leave bedding on it.
-   I also wash the dishes and take out the trash.

> Kurzfassung: Schlüssel da lassen, Tür zuziehen, das wars. 😀

## Tips

With the Leipzig MOVE app, you get 10 free rides of 15 minutes each_Nextbikes_. Note that it costs more if you don't park your bikes on the main streets (purple on the map). The e-scooters may only be parked in certain parking spaces.

## Questions?

If you have any questions or need support, I will be happy to help you. If you're in a hurry, it's best to do so via telephone <a href="tel:+491707353067">+49 170 73 53 067</a>. You can also use the pre-installed messenger app with limited functionality (SMS). Otherwise, I have a notepad and a pen in the hallway.

I wish you a nice stay in Leipzig!
Andre
